Zip File: Source code, README file (optional).<br>
Tasks and Activities<br>
<br>1. Data Collection and Exploration<br>

Load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.<br>
Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.<br>
Identify outliers and consider appropriate handling techniques.<br>
Convert the date column to a datetime format.<br>
<br>2. Data Balancing<br>

Given the imbalanced nature of the dataset, employ techniques like:<br>
Oversampling (e.g., SMOTE)<br>
Undersampling<br>
Class weighting<br>
<br>3. Feature Engineering<br>

Create new features that might be informative for fraud detection (e.g., time-based features, transaction amounts relative to historical averages).<br>
Consider feature selection techniques (e.g., correlation analysis, recursive feature elimination) to identify the most relevant features.<br>
<br>4. Model Selection and Training<br>

Choose appropriate classification algorithms for imbalanced datasets (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machines).<br>
Split the data into training and testing sets.<br>
Train the selected models on the training set.<br>
<br>5. Model Evaluation<br>

Use metrics suitable for imbalanced datasets (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC).<br>
Evaluate the models on the testing set.<br>
<br>6. Hyperparameter Tuning<br>

Optimize model performance by tuning hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search. Â  <br>
<br>7. Model Deployment Planning<br>

Outline the steps involved in deploying the model into a production environment.<br>
Consider factors like scalability, maintainability, and monitoring.<br>
Success Metrics<br>
Accuracy: The model should achieve an accuracy of over 75% on the test dataset.<br>
Imbalanced Dataset Handling: Effective techniques should be employed to address the class imbalance.<br>
Hyperparameter Tuning: The model's performance should be optimized through hyperparameter tuning.<br>
Model Validation: Proper model validation techniques should be used to assess generalization performance.<br>
